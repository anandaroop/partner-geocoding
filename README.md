# Partner Geocoding

This collection of ad-hoc tools supports analysis and improvement of partner location geocoding.

Tools typically are custom UIs built with Create React App, and driven by a datafile that represents either a database query, the results of a database update, and/or the results of a geocoding operation.

- [Heatmap](heatmap) — A visualization that uses a heatmap and spider clustering to highlight potentially spurious geocoding hotspots

- [Geodiff](geodiff) — A tool for visually reviewing the differences among a set of geocodes for each partner.
